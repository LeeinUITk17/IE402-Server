# GIS Intro (for team)

- GIS basics: spatial data (vector/raster), coordinate systems, projections (VN-2000, WGS84), layers.
- For this project, we start with textual sources and district-level aggregates; maps can be added later.
- Useful keywords: PostGIS, GeoJSON, shapefile, GDAL/OGR, CRS, tiling.
- Recommended reading list: add links in `docs/DATA_SOURCES.md`.
