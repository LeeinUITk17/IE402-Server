# Web Client (FE) Guide

The frontend currently lives in `ie402/` (Next.js). The `clients/Web_Client/README.md` documents expectations.

## Week 1
- Find a simple UI reference (landing + district selector + metrics cards + map placeholder).
- Build minimal pages: home, district details, about.
- Wire to mock APIs from Web_Server when available.

## Components (suggested)
- DistrictSelector, MetricCard, MapPlaceholder, DataTabs.

## Styling
- Keep it simple; use Tailwind if already configured or CSS Modules.
