# GIS Team Guide

## Scope
- Collect and evaluate district data for HCMC (e.g., Q1, Binh Thanh, Q10, Thu Duc).
- Domains: Infrastructure, Population, Traffic, Land, Environment.
- Mark usable sections and maintain links in `docs/DATA_SOURCES.md`.

## Deliverables (week 1)
- A list of candidate sources per district with short notes on usability.
- Pick top 3 districts with the most complete data.
- Highlight usable paragraphs/sections; propose JSON fields for each domain.

## Folder
- `services/GIS_Server/`
  - `data/` (placeholder)
  - `README.md` (setup, internal API plan)

## How to evaluate sources
- Credibility (gov portals, academic, reputable media) > random blogs.
- Coverage per domain.
- Data recency.
- Licenses/terms of use.

## Next steps
- Work with Data_Processor to define JSON schemas.
- Provide district boundary references if available.
